Sous vide cooking is the term for cooking food under a significantly lower temperature than normally.

We know that fo example meat has a specific doneness under an exact internal temperature. Therefore we can cook this in our sous vide with this temperature. This results in a perfect temperature and aoneness, also this avoids the typical dryness of ordinary high heat cooking methods, because the outside temperature stays low.

## Praxis

For cooking your piece of food you vacuum sealk it, for better flavor penetration you add salt, flavoring (spieces, garlic etc) into the bag.

There is a low cost alternative to vacuum sealing the meat.
You can bag the food with a simple plastic bag and then submerge the bag in a water bath
